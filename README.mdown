# Installing

Install this Vim plugin like you would do for any other one.  In this
unfortunate case, it seems that Vim already ships with a built-in file type
detection for `*.rules` files (apparently they're `hog` files).

I'm still figuring out how to best overrule Vim's defaults so it would be
enough to just install this Vim plugin.  **If you know how, please let me
know!** üôè

For now, you'll have to install this Vim plugin like normal, but then still
also make the following hack:

Create (or edit) the file `~/.vim/filetype.vim` manually, and put the
following in there:

```
" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
" NOTE: The following hack is necessary to get a change to detect the file
" type of *.rules files _before_ Vim does it for us (and concludes that
" they're Hog files).
"
" This could be removed once vim-rule-of-law knows how to override this from
" a plugin.

if exists("did_load_filetypes")
    finish
endif

augroup filetypedetect

    " Ignore filetypes for *.rules files
    autocmd! BufNewFile,BufRead *.rules setfiletype rule-of-law

augroup END

" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
